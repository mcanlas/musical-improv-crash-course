# Verse

## Function

A verse is where you can get more details out. You can elaborate on the details of the thesis that was established with the chorus.

Everything sung in the verse should be in support of the perspective in the chorus.

A verse is more conversational, not very repetitive, and much more lyrically complex. Contrast with a chorus which is generally very repetitive and easy to remember.

{% hint style="info" %}
Verses should sound different from choruses. Try not to repeat phrases used in the chorus. And try not to introduce repetition in verses.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Try not to use the word "but", since it introductions a competing perspective.
