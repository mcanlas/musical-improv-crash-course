# Building blocks

Structure is the difference between songs and singing.

## Common properties

Almost every song element or "block" will be four musical lines long.

Beware of short lyrical lines that are not the same length as musical lines. A block will always be four musical lines regardless of how the lyrics are sung.

## Splitting

Splitting verses, bridges, or choruses is usually related to how perspectives were established earlier in the scene. There are multiple ways to split a block. It could be take two lines each.

> Line 1 \(Perspective A\)  
> Line 2 \(Perspective A\)  
> Line 3 \(Perspective B\)  
> Line 4 \(Perspective B\)

Or it could be line for line.

> Line 1 \(Perspective A\)  
> Line 2 \(Perspective B\)  
> Line 3 \(Perspective A\)  
> Line 4 \(Perspective B\)

Characters can also sing over one another.
