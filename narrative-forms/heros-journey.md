# Hero's journey

## Show structure

1. Protagonist scene
2. Scene with protagonist
3. Scene with protagonist
4. Scene with protagonist
5. Scene with protagonist

## Protagonist

Exact same as the fairytale.

## Subsequent scenes

Subsequent scenes are an opportunity to see how different characters in the world help or hinder the protagonist.

Every scene should physically include the protagonist. The protagonist should not be leading those scenes or singing the bulk of those songs.

## Wants and consequences

In this show format, sometimes it's better to give the protagonist what they want right away and then deal with the ramifications. Was everything as expected or was there some weird turn?

Any want like "I want to visit some place" or "I want to do some job" should be met with giving that want and seeing how everyone is affected.
