# Narrative forms

## Opening number content {#last-ditch-ending}

Don't use "I" or "me" statements in the opening number for a narrative. We don't want characters being established prematurely. It should focus on world building or descriptions in the second person \(e.g. "You know when this happens...", "You can..."\).

## Choosing a form {#last-ditch-ending}

If you're doing a freestyle show, note that the fairytale and narrative start the exact same way \(with a protagonist scene\).

## Two chorus out {#last-ditch-ending}

If a show is running low on time, the last number can be an abbreviated form like this one.

1. Chorus \(solo\)
2. Chorus \(tutti\)

## Last ditch ending

Sometimes there won't be a clean ending to a show or there won't be a consensus on how to end a show. One way of getting to an ending is to say something like "I think we all learned something here today." and then sing a short song about that.
