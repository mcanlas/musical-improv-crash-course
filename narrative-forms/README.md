# Narrative forms

## Opening number content

Don't use "I" or "my" statements in the opening number for a narrative. We don't want characters being established prematurely. It should focus on world building or descriptions in the second person \(e.g. "You know when this happens...", "You can..."\). You can use "we" as long as the perspective is very broad and isn't building specific characters.

## Choosing a form

If you're doing a freestyle show, note that the fairytale and narrative start the exact same way \(with a protagonist scene\).

## Two chorus out

If a show is running low on time, the last number can be an abbreviated form like this one.

1. Chorus \(solo\)
2. Chorus \(tutti\)

## Last ditch ending

Sometimes there won't be a clean ending to a show or there won't be a consensus on how to end a show. One way of getting to an ending is to say something like "I think we all learned something here today." and then sing a short song about what was learned.
