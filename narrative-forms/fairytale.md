# Fairytale

This format is good for 25-min class shows. Not suitable for 20-min house shows given the length.

## Show structure

1. Protagonist scene
2. Antagonist scene
3. Charm scene
4. Moment of doubt
5. Resolution

## Protagonist

Often a two person scene. One character will establish a want with a want song.

A good want is something that is noble and difficult to obtain. Shouldn't be "I want to  take over the world" or "I want to eat a sandwich".

Sometimes there can be a dual protagonist, two people that have the same want and function as one character.

## Antagonist

Often a two person scene. One character will establish a villainous philosophy with a tagline or philosophy song. Think Disney villain with henchmen or sidekicks.

A good antagonist does not exist to directly oppose the protagonist. The antagonist exists separately, doing their own thing, and their normal evil life happens to prevent the protagonist from getting what they want. The antagonist probably does not know that the protagonist exists \(at least in this scene\).

Sometimes there can be a dual antagonist, two or more people that have the same philosophy and status and function as one character.

## Charm scene

If this were a Disney movie, this is where the animals of the forest show up. If during the opening number or protagonist scene there are other characters mentioned \(like students, parents, or villagers\), this would be a good place to bring them up.

They typically have three distinct points of view.

This scene is a palette cleanser from the evil song in Scene 2. It should be light and fun and empty on plot.

## Moment of doubt

This is when the protagonist and antagonist meet for the first time. The protagonist should be close to getting what they want and then have it stripped away at the last second. The team should enhance how badly things are going for the protagonist.

This is typically sung as a protagonist solo.

## Resolution

Usually one of the charm characters will magically find a solution. The protagonist should get the want established in Scene 1 and the antagonist should get their comeuppance.

Typically sung as a two-chorus out.

{% hint style="info" %}
Improvisors will often "argue" or debate about solutions if there are multiple on the table. Shows will typically be racing to an ending at this point, so it's best to jump on the first solution suggested and end the show that way.
