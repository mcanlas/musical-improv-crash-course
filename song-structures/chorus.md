# Chorus

## Function

A chorus is the "thesis" or core of the song. If the song can be summed up into one or two catchy lines, those lines are the chorus.

A chorus is generally very repetitive and easy to remember. Contrast with a verse which is not very repetitive and difficult to remember.

Choruses are generally sung "out" and more boldly than verses.

## Chorus structure

A chorus is four musical lines long. Each line will be designated a type, either "A" or "B". Lines of the same type will sound the same, typically lyrically.

> Line 1: I love cats.  
> Line 2: I love cats.  
> Line 3: I love cats.  
> Line 4: I love cats.

Each line is an "A" line. Even though the lyrics are the same for each line, they can sound different musically/melodically.

If a line was different than the others, it would be a "B" line.

> Line 1: I love cats.  
> Line 2: I love cats.  
> Line 3: I love cats.  
> Line 4: More than anything.

Line 4 is a "B" line.

If a coach mentions "C" or "D" lines, it means you've chosen something too complex.

## Types of choruses

* **AAAA** - easiest
* **AAAB** - not common
* **AABA** - most common
* **AABB** - difficult to remember
* **ABAB** - difficult to remember

{% hint style="info" %}
The **AABA** structure is often sung as **AA\*A**, meaning that the third line is different each time the chorus is revisited. This is a good option to have, especially if no one remembers the B line or if someone wants it to be something much more different/complicated.

## Perspectives and tweaking lyrics

Sometimes a chorus will be established from the perspective of one character. If supporting players sang the exact same lyrics, the pronouns wouldn't make sense. You can tweak the lyrics.

> Primary singer: I love cats.  
> Scene partner: You love cats.

There can also be changes in perspectives if there's a discovery or someone is  convinced of something.

> Verse 1: \(stuff about loving cats\)  
> Chorus 1 A line: I love cats.  
> Verse 2: \(more stuff about loving cats\)  
> Chorus 2 A line: I love cats.  
> Bridge: \(the dark side of cats\)  
> Chorus 3 A line: I hate cats.

## Common problem: Half chorus

Be careful of a "half chorus". Take this chorus as an example.

> Line 1: I love cats.  
> Line 2: They are cute.  
> Line 3: I love cats.  
> Line 4: They are cute.

If each line is sung as a shorter musical phrase, it would look like this.

> Line 1: I love cats. They are cute.  
> Line 2: I love cats. They are cute.

Notice how this chorus is only two musical lines long even though there are four sentences. Chorus length is determined by the music, not the lyrics.
