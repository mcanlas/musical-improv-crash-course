# Trio

## Song structure

1. Chorus A
2. Chorus B
3. Chorus C
4. Chorus \(tutti\)
5. Chorus \(key change and repeat\)

## Function

This structure is good for getting out three distinct points of view.

It's often used by charm characters in a narrative form.

It's a crowd-pleaser.

## Lyrical content

Sometimes one perspective out of the three will be the "wacky" one. This is typically sung last.

1. Chorus A: \(someone who loves cats\)
2. Chorus B: \(someone who dislikes cats\)
3. Chorus C: \(someone who prefers robots\)

## Musical content

Since the three choruses will be layered on top of one another, this works best with three choruses that sound musically distinct.

If the first chorus is more legato, the second one can be more staccato.

If the first chorus moves up in the melody, the second one can move down instead.

The third chorus is generally the most interesting since it should fill in gaps left by the other two choruses. It can feature less typical elements like syncopation or sound effects.

{% hint style="info" %}
Don't choose the same chorus structure. If someone is already doing **AABA**, choose a different chorus structure.

{% hint style="info" %}
Many trio choruses will \(unintentionally\) leave silence on beats 7 and 8. Fill the silence with something. You can always modify your chorus after it's been established to better fill the gaps the you discover.
