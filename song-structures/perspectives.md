# Perspectives

Most scenes, regardless of how many characters, can be boiled down into perspectives. Multiple characters can share one perspective and then function as one character.

## Two perspectives

Most scenes will feature two distinct perspectives. The person or perspective who earns the song should sing the first perspective established in the verses and the second perspective should be featured in the bridge.

## One perspective \("peas in a pod"\)

If the scene ends up having one shared perspective \(also called characters being "peas in a pod"\), then more of the elements can be shared freely instead of waiting for the bridge.
