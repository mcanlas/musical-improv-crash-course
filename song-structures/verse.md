# Verse

## Function

A verse is where you can get more details out. You can elaborate on the details of the thesis that was established with the chorus.

A verse is more conversational, not very repetitive, and much more lyrically complex. Contrast with a chorus which is generally very repetitive and easy to remember.

{% hint style="info" %}
Verses should sound different from choruses. Try not to repeat phrases used in the chorus. And try not to introduce repetition in verses.
