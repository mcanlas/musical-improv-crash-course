# Bridge

## Function

A bridge is the opportunity to explore a different perspective than the one established in the verses and chorus. It has the same lyrical complexity as a verse and lacks repetition just like a verse.

In general, a bridge is signified by a change in musical tone or quality from the accompanist.

## Bridge structure

A bridge is four musical lines long.

## Bridge content

A traditional bridge bridge is filled with an alternate or opposing perspective. If each verse was about "I like the winter", the bridge could be "bad parts about the winter". If the song was a "want song", the bridge could be about potential costs or downsides of that want.

Common lyrical prompts for bridges are "But what about" or "What if".

One teacher has said this style leads to awkward jumps in thought because a bridge is typically followed by a chorus where the original perspective is restored. Their proposed prompt is "Some people think..." allowing the character to talk about opposing perspectives using external forces rather than mental gymnastics.

Another way to sing the bridge is to double down emotionally. If the song is about wanting a cat, the bridge can be about heightening that want even more to the point of absurdity.
