# Differences from regular improv

Musical improv is generally more emotional than regular improv. Everything ramps much faster emotionally.

If you feel like your scene isn't going anywhere, it's probably because you don't know how you feel or haven't made it known to everyone.

It's better to focus on the relationships between characters and how they make each other feel rather than external things like problem solving or characters that are not on stage. Don't solve problems, just be affected by them.

## When does the song start?

The song starts when the accompanist feels like you've reached such a heightened state of emotion that there's no choice but to sing.

If you feel like a song should have started but you aren't getting one, repeat how you feel with conviction until you and the accompanist are on the same page.
