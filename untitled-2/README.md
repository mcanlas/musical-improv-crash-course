# Song structures

## Ending a song

Every song will have either a chorus or a tagline. Songs are typically ended by elongating the last line or singing it twice.

Here's a song ending with a chorus with the last line sung twice.

> Last chorus line 1: They are fluffy.  
> Last chorus line 2: I love cats.  
> Last chorus line 3: They are fluffy.  
> Last chorus line 4: I love cats.  
>   
> Ending line: I love cats.

Here's a song with a backline tag with the tagline sung slower.

> Last verse line 1: ...  
> Last verse line 2: ...  
> Last verse line 3: ...  
> Last verse tagline 4: I love cats. \(song ends here\)

Here's a song with a frontline tag with the tagline repeated.

> Last verse tagline: I love cats.  
> Last verse line 2: ...  
> Last verse line 3: ...  
> Last verse line 4: ...  
>   
> Ending line: I love cats.

## Off structure

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are not clear where in a song form you are with your scene partner or the accompanist, one strategy is to just start a very simple chorus. This will give everyone an opportunity to get back onto the same page.

## Choosing a structure

Most of the time, you won't know what song structure a scene will use. Even a scene with three characters may not be a trio if there are only two distinct perspectives \(i.e. multiple characters have the same perspective\).

{% hint style="info" %}
Commit like you will sing the whole song.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Sing the first eight lines. This allows one character to establish a verse and a chorus that fit together thematically. In a tagline song, it allows one person to decide if the song is frontline or backline.
{% endhint %}
