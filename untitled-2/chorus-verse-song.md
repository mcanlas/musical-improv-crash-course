# Chorus verse song

## Song structure

1. Chorus
2. Verse \(1\)
3. Chorus
4. Wildcard
5. Chorus

The fourth block is the "wildcard", meaning it can be a bridge or a verse. Either option is four musical lines lacking repetition.

## Function

This structure is good if you stumble into a chorus very early into the scene.

This structure is good if you are on a time crunch since it is a short form.

This structure is good for getting out one or two perspectives. If the wildcard is a verse, it's one perspective. If the wildcard is a bridge, it's two perspectives.
